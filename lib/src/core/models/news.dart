        'Uncertainty in Springfield, the Ohio town put on the map by Trump’s false claims about immigrants',
    body:
        'SPRINGFIELD, Ohio: In the months leading up to Election Day, political signs and billboards dotted much of the landscape surrounding this town in southwestern Ohio. By that weekend, many were gone.\n\nResidents, tired and frustrated after their hometown became a national flashpoint in the election over immigration, were trying to move past the intense scrutiny and refocus on the future.\n\n“It is what it is. We have to live with it,” Jean Philistin, a Haitian resident of Springfield, said of Donald Trump’s victory. “The American people, they wanted him and they elected him.”\n\nOnly a couple of months ago, Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, helped perpetuate false rumors about Haitian residents in Springfield eating pets and local wildlife even after city and county officials denied the claims.\n\nThe city became a kind of parable of the strains that accompany a sudden influx of migrants, such as rising rents and longer wait times for medical and social services, making Springfield fodder for pro-Trump partisans who then used racist claims to bring it to a national audience.\n\nAfter the election, NBC News returned to the town and spoke with more than a dozen residents who offered a mix of hope and fear about the weeks, months and years to come. Mostly, they were hesitant to talk about the election even after its decisive conclusion.\n\nPhilistin, who became an American citizen two years ago and voted for the first time, remains unsettled by the election results. He voted for Vice President Kamala Harris and has relatives in New Jersey who voted for Trump.\n\nHe said they were attracted to Trump’s economic policies, but his rhetoric on immigration went too far for Philistin, and he said he fears they don’t understand how some of Trump\'s policies could impact other Haitians.\n\nOn election night, Philistin was glued to the TV, he said. A week later, he wondered how a Trump White House will affect his community.\n\n“I’m nervous, but I’m not upset,” he said.\n\nSupport for Trump did not waver in the reliably conservative Clark County despite his false claims about Springfield.\n\nTrump won 64% of the vote in the county, up from 61% in 2020. Fueled by economic concerns, a red wave walloped Democratic lawmakers across Ohio. Longtime U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who has held his seat since 2007, lost to newcomer and Trump ally Bernie Moreno.\n\nChristian Jordan, who was born in Venezuela and moved to Springfield some 20 years ago, said he voted for Trump despite the president-elect’s sometimes bombastic descriptions of his native country and his adopted home. A self-described “big supporter of the Republican party,” Jordan said Trump’s economic policies outweigh his hyperbole.\n\n“Maybe the representation isn’t perfect, but it’s politics,” he said. “You’re able to kind of look past it.”\n\nLast Saturday, Jordan attended an Ohio State University football game and attendees joked about Springfield residents eating cats, he said. He laughed along with everyone else but lamented Springfield’s newfound reputation as undeserved.\n\n“That’s not how you want to be remembered as a town,” he said. “Springfield is trying very hard to continue to move on.”',

        'Court ruling stops Louisiana from requiring Ten Commandments in classrooms for now',
    body:
        'NEW ORLEANS — Louisiana’s plan to make all of the state’s public school classrooms post the Ten Commandments next year remains on hold under an order Wednesday by a federal appeals court in New Orleans. /n/nThe 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a state request to temporarily stay an earlier order by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles in Baton Rouge while litigation continues. Arguments before a 5th Circuit panel are scheduled for Jan. 23, meaning the judge’s order stays in effect well past the law’s Jan. 1 deadline to post the commandments. /n/nThe state contends that deGravelles’ order affects only the five school districts that are defendants in a legal challenge. But it’s unclear whether or how the law would be enforced in the state’s 67 other districts while the appeal progresses. Also, deGravelles ordered that all schools in every district be notified of his decision that the law is unconstitutional, a requirement maintained by Wednesday’s ruling. /n/n“We’re pleased that the Court of Appeals left the district court’s injunction fully intact,” said Sam Grover, an attorney with the Freedom From Religion Foundation. “As the district court ruled, this law is unconstitutional on its face.” /n/nState Attorney General Liz Murrill said in an emailed statement that her office would “continue to defend this clearly constitutional law.” /n/nDeGravelles ruled that the law, passed by the GOP-dominated Legislature, was “overtly religious” and “unconstitutional on its face.” He also said it amounted to unconstitutional religious government coercion of students, who are legally required to attend school. /n/nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill into law in June, prompting a group of Louisiana public school parents of different faiths to sue. They argue the law violates the First Amendment’s provisions forbidding the government from establishing a religion or blocking the free exercise of it. They also say the proposed poster-sized display would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian. The parents further argue that the version of the Ten Commandments specified in the law is favored by many protestants and doesn’t match any version found in Jewish tradition. /n/nProponents say the Ten Commandments are not solely religious and have a historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law. Murrill, the Republican attorney general, has said she disagreed with deGravelles’ ruling and that the law is constitutional under Supreme Court precedents. /n/nThe state’s loss in court on Wednesday came after a partial victory last week, when a 5th Circuit panel temporarily blocked instructions in DeGravelles’ order that state education officials notify schools in all districts of his finding that the law is unconstitutional. /n/nAlthough Wednesday’s decision ended that block, Murrill, in her statement, reiterated the state’s stance that only districts that are defendants in the lawsuit — in East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St. Tammany, Orleans and Vernon parishes — are affected by deGravelles’ order. /n/n“There are more than sixty school boards that are not subject to the ruling of the court,” she said. /n/nIn recent years, similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. None have passed. /n/nIn 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional. The court found that the law had a plainly religious purpose and no secular one. /n/nLouisiana’s legislation, which applies to all public K-12 schools and state-funded university classrooms, requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed on a poster or framed document at least 11 inches by 14 inches where the text is the central focus and “printed in a large, easily readable font.” /n/nEach poster must be paired with a four-paragraph “context statement” describing how the Ten Commandments “were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.” /n/nTens of thousands of posters would likely be needed to satisfy the new law. Proponents say schools are not required to spend public money on them and that donors can provide the posters or money to buy them.',

        'After a stinging election defeat, the Democrats\' next big race kicks off: From the Politics Desk',
    body:
        'TWO WEEKS after suffering another stinging defeat to Donald Trump, Democrats are in the throes of dissecting what went wrong and figuring out their path forward. /n/nAnd the first concrete step in beginning their next chapter is already underway: selecting a new chair of the national party committee. /n/nThe post will take on outsize importance for a defeated party lacking a clear leader, especially in the run-up to the 2028 presidential election, when the new chair will have to oversee the party’s primary and its controversial new calendar imposed by President Joe Biden. /n/nOver the past 48 hours, a bevy of contenders interested in succeeding Jaime Harrison as the chair of the Democratic National Committee have either officially jumped into the race or seen their names floated as options. /n/nIt started Monday, when former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a onetime presidential candidate and the commissioner of the Social Security Administration, kicked off the race by entering the fray. Minnesota Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin, a DNC vice chair and leader of the Association of State Democratic Committees, followed by formally announcing his candidacy Tuesday. /n/nBoth Martin and O’Malley stressed ongoing investments in state parties as key to their vision for moving the DNC forward. /n/nAlso on Tuesday, Latino Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha confirmed on X that he was in the running. So far, the only woman to emerge as a possible candidate, as Politico reported, is Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow. She drew national acclaim on the left in 2022 after she delivered a speech in defiance of a Republican who cast her as a “groomer” in a fundraising appeal, which led to a speaking slot at this summer’s Democratic National Convention. /n/nStill looming out there: Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, who has developed a reputation as a prodigious fundraiser and field organizer. /n/n“Ben is seriously considering a run,” a person with knowledge of Wikler’s thinking told NBC News on Monday. /n/nThat’s on top of chatter around Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, former Chicago mayor and chief of staff to then-President Barack Obama. Emanuel has reached out to other DNC members to test the waters, according to two people close to him. /n/nThe DNC vice chair position is also drawing attention. Adam Parkhomenko, a Democratic operative who worked on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns, is considering a bid for the post, for which he unsuccessfully ran in 2017. /n/n“I am seriously considering stepping back into the race, and I promise to take the time to weigh this decision carefully, with the same dedication to our party and values that I’ve always carried,” Parkhomenko said in a message to supporters obtained by NBC News. /n/nAlso eyeing a run for the vice chair position is James Zogby, the founder of the Arab American Institute and longtime former DNC member who has criticized the party from the left. /n/nWhile it’s still too early to get a clear sense of the fault lines that will define the DNC leadership races, the 50-state strategy could be one. This is a vision — investing in red, blue and swing states alike — that Martin in particular has fully embraced. If Emanuel does get into the race, it’s a strategy he famously opposed, even getting into a public feud with Howard Dean over it, arguing the party should train its focus on battleground states. /n/nThe race could also expose divisions between an old era, one that embraced Obama — who had drastically diminished the role of the DNC and state parties by setting up a parallel entity in Organizing for America — and new faces who would bring fresh ideas to a party in search of a way forward. /n/nTrump is burning his political capital quickly /n/nBy Chuck Todd /n/nHere’s the political problem Donald Trump is creating for himself with his picks for the Cabinet and other positions: He’s taking full ownership of the entire bureaucracy now. There is no fantasy or mythical “deep state” to blame for not fulfilling his promises. He’s appointing folks he says share his vision — so no excuses of being jammed by the ol’ establishment wing of the GOP (like what happened in his first term). /n/nThis time, he has to deliver, and his ability to deliver depends on whether he can put together a stable set of political actors to not only do his bidding but also somehow deliver on his promises to a whole new group of voters who are “trying out” Trumpism for the very first time. /n/nIf the next six months at the Pentagon are more about which bathrooms folks can or can’t use and who can or can’t defend the country, Trump is going to find himself taking more of the heat for his controversial pick of defense chief than his actual pick for the post. /n/nThere are a lot of potential land mines that Trump and the newly empowered GOP need to avoid. One is misreading their mandate on the culture front. /n/nWhat many voters appeared to say with their votes, culturally, is that they don’t like to be told how they should behave. There’s a fierce libertarian streak in this country, and it can look “left” or “right” depending on which party is in power. If the Republicans go from preaching against “DEI” to essentially imposing their own culture, forcing Bible study in public schools (see Oklahoma) or using gender stereotypes rather than pure merit to decide whether someone belongs on the front lines of combat, then they will be committing the same sin they accused coastal elites of committing, of “imposing their own culture” on a public that doesn’t agree with their every belief. /n/nAnd this is the very risk Trump has already invited by deciding to pick the most controversial firebrand one could find in some of these key positions. If his picks cause instability, the public will reject this administration faster than he thinks. /n/nOne thing Trump and the GOP are already misreading about his so-called mandate is that he was elected despite his personal unpopularity. That is, he wasn’t elected proactively by the voters who took him over the edge; he was elected because of who he was not. /n/nThis wasn’t a decision voters made because they like Trump. To the contrary, they made this decision because they didn’t think the Biden-Harris administration understood how they live their lives. Does Trump understand it? Perhaps he doesn’t, but he certainly knew how to channel their frustrations into a vote-getting message, and he certainly exposed the Democrats as not having any clue about how the working class was faring in this economy. /n/nBut these moments of peak political capital are fleeting, and when they go, they go. Just ask Biden.',

        'California voters reject ballot measure to increase the state\'s minimum wage',
    body:
        'VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA have narrowly rejected a ballot measure that would have gradually increased the minimum wage in the state to \$18 per hour, NBC News projected Wednesday. /n/nIt’s the first time a ballot measure proposing to raise the statewide minimum wage has failed nationwide since 1996. /n/nThe California measure, listed as Proposition 32 on the ballot, proposed bumping the state\'s minimum wage to \$18 per hour by 2026, which would have made it the highest in the U.S. /n/nWith 92% of the vote counted, the “no” vote against the measure had the support of 50.8% of voters, while the “yes” vote had 49.2%. /n/nSupporters of the measure said it would have benefitted workers, while opponents argued that its passage would have increased costs for employers, which would have likely prompted them to fire employees. /n/nThe California Chamber of Commerce, which opposed the measure, lauded its defeat in a statement. /n/n“CalChamber opposed Prop. 32 because it would have resulted in higher costs for small business employers and consumers,” the group\'s CEO, Jennifer Barrera, said in a statement. “With the economy and costs top of mind for many voters this election, that message appears to have resonated.” /n/nCalifornia’s current state minimum wage for most workers is \$16 per hour, though under a law signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that went into effect in March, the minimum wage for many fast food workers is \$20 per hour. /n/nAnother law signed by Newsom increased the minimum wage in the state for many health care workers to \$25 per hour starting last month. /n/nCalifornia’s current \$16 minimum wage is already among the highest in the nation. Some cities within New York also implement a minimum wage of \$16 per hour, while Washington state’s minimum wage is \$16.26 per hour. Hawaii’s minimum wage is set to gradually increase to \$18 per hour in 2028 under a law passed in 2022. /n/nThe defeat is the first time in 28 years that a ballot measure to increase a state minimum wage was defeated. According to Ballotpedia, which tracks the outcomes of statewide ballot measures, voters had passed all 26 measures to increase state minimum wages that appeared on statewide ballots since 1996, when voters in Missouri and Montana rejected increases. /n/nMeanwhile, ballot measures in two other states to increase the minimum wage overwhelmingly passed this month. /n/nVoters in Alaska and Missouri approved measures to gradually raise their state minimum wages to \$15 per hour by 2026, according to NBC News projections, with increases after that year attached to economic data. Both measures won by 16-point margins.',
