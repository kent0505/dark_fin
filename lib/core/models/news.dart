        'Uncertainty in Springfield, the Ohio town put on the map by Trump’s false claims about immigrants',
    body:
        'SPRINGFIELD, Ohio: In the months leading up to Election Day, political signs and billboards dotted much of the landscape surrounding this town in southwestern Ohio. By that weekend, many were gone.\n\nResidents, tired and frustrated after their hometown became a national flashpoint in the election over immigration, were trying to move past the intense scrutiny and refocus on the future.\n\n“It is what it is. We have to live with it,” Jean Philistin, a Haitian resident of Springfield, said of Donald Trump’s victory. “The American people, they wanted him and they elected him.”\n\nOnly a couple of months ago, Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, helped perpetuate false rumors about Haitian residents in Springfield eating pets and local wildlife even after city and county officials denied the claims.\n\nThe city became a kind of parable of the strains that accompany a sudden influx of migrants, such as rising rents and longer wait times for medical and social services, making Springfield fodder for pro-Trump partisans who then used racist claims to bring it to a national audience.\n\nAfter the election, NBC News returned to the town and spoke with more than a dozen residents who offered a mix of hope and fear about the weeks, months and years to come. Mostly, they were hesitant to talk about the election even after its decisive conclusion.\n\nPhilistin, who became an American citizen two years ago and voted for the first time, remains unsettled by the election results. He voted for Vice President Kamala Harris and has relatives in New Jersey who voted for Trump.\n\nHe said they were attracted to Trump’s economic policies, but his rhetoric on immigration went too far for Philistin, and he said he fears they don’t understand how some of Trump\'s policies could impact other Haitians.\n\nOn election night, Philistin was glued to the TV, he said. A week later, he wondered how a Trump White House will affect his community.\n\n“I’m nervous, but I’m not upset,” he said.\n\nSupport for Trump did not waver in the reliably conservative Clark County despite his false claims about Springfield.\n\nTrump won 64% of the vote in the county, up from 61% in 2020. Fueled by economic concerns, a red wave walloped Democratic lawmakers across Ohio. Longtime U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who has held his seat since 2007, lost to newcomer and Trump ally Bernie Moreno.\n\nChristian Jordan, who was born in Venezuela and moved to Springfield some 20 years ago, said he voted for Trump despite the president-elect’s sometimes bombastic descriptions of his native country and his adopted home. A self-described “big supporter of the Republican party,” Jordan said Trump’s economic policies outweigh his hyperbole.\n\n“Maybe the representation isn’t perfect, but it’s politics,” he said. “You’re able to kind of look past it.”\n\nLast Saturday, Jordan attended an Ohio State University football game and attendees joked about Springfield residents eating cats, he said. He laughed along with everyone else but lamented Springfield’s newfound reputation as undeserved.\n\n“That’s not how you want to be remembered as a town,” he said. “Springfield is trying very hard to continue to move on.”',

        'Court ruling stops Louisiana from requiring Ten Commandments in classrooms for now',
    body:
        'NEW ORLEANS — Louisiana’s plan to make all of the state’s public school classrooms post the Ten Commandments next year remains on hold under an order Wednesday by a federal appeals court in New Orleans. \n\nThe 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a state request to temporarily stay an earlier order by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles in Baton Rouge while litigation continues. Arguments before a 5th Circuit panel are scheduled for Jan. 23, meaning the judge’s order stays in effect well past the law’s Jan. 1 deadline to post the commandments. \n\nThe state contends that deGravelles’ order affects only the five school districts that are defendants in a legal challenge. But it’s unclear whether or how the law would be enforced in the state’s 67 other districts while the appeal progresses. Also, deGravelles ordered that all schools in every district be notified of his decision that the law is unconstitutional, a requirement maintained by Wednesday’s ruling. \n\n“We’re pleased that the Court of Appeals left the district court’s injunction fully intact,” said Sam Grover, an attorney with the Freedom From Religion Foundation. “As the district court ruled, this law is unconstitutional on its face.” \n\nState Attorney General Liz Murrill said in an emailed statement that her office would “continue to defend this clearly constitutional law.” \n\nDeGravelles ruled that the law, passed by the GOP-dominated Legislature, was “overtly religious” and “unconstitutional on its face.” He also said it amounted to unconstitutional religious government coercion of students, who are legally required to attend school. \n\nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill into law in June, prompting a group of Louisiana public school parents of different faiths to sue. They argue the law violates the First Amendment’s provisions forbidding the government from establishing a religion or blocking the free exercise of it. They also say the proposed poster-sized display would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian. The parents further argue that the version of the Ten Commandments specified in the law is favored by many protestants and doesn’t match any version found in Jewish tradition. \n\nProponents say the Ten Commandments are not solely religious and have a historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law. Murrill, the Republican attorney general, has said she disagreed with deGravelles’ ruling and that the law is constitutional under Supreme Court precedents. \n\nThe state’s loss in court on Wednesday came after a partial victory last week, when a 5th Circuit panel temporarily blocked instructions in DeGravelles’ order that state education officials notify schools in all districts of his finding that the law is unconstitutional. \n\nAlthough Wednesday’s decision ended that block, Murrill, in her statement, reiterated the state’s stance that only districts that are defendants in the lawsuit — in East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St. Tammany, Orleans and Vernon parishes — are affected by deGravelles’ order. \n\n“There are more than sixty school boards that are not subject to the ruling of the court,” she said. \n\nIn recent years, similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. None have passed. \n\nIn 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional. The court found that the law had a plainly religious purpose and no secular one. \n\nLouisiana’s legislation, which applies to all public K-12 schools and state-funded university classrooms, requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed on a poster or framed document at least 11 inches by 14 inches where the text is the central focus and “printed in a large, easily readable font.” \n\nEach poster must be paired with a four-paragraph “context statement” describing how the Ten Commandments “were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.” \n\nTens of thousands of posters would likely be needed to satisfy the new law. Proponents say schools are not required to spend public money on them and that donors can provide the posters or money to buy them.',

        'After a stinging election defeat, the Democrats\' next big race kicks off: From the Politics Desk',
    body:
        'TWO WEEKS after suffering another stinging defeat to Donald Trump, Democrats are in the throes of dissecting what went wrong and figuring out their path forward. \n\nAnd the first concrete step in beginning their next chapter is already underway: selecting a new chair of the national party committee. \n\nThe post will take on outsize importance for a defeated party lacking a clear leader, especially in the run-up to the 2028 presidential election, when the new chair will have to oversee the party’s primary and its controversial new calendar imposed by President Joe Biden. \n\nOver the past 48 hours, a bevy of contenders interested in succeeding Jaime Harrison as the chair of the Democratic National Committee have either officially jumped into the race or seen their names floated as options. \n\nIt started Monday, when former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a onetime presidential candidate and the commissioner of the Social Security Administration, kicked off the race by entering the fray. Minnesota Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin, a DNC vice chair and leader of the Association of State Democratic Committees, followed by formally announcing his candidacy Tuesday. \n\nBoth Martin and O’Malley stressed ongoing investments in state parties as key to their vision for moving the DNC forward. \n\nAlso on Tuesday, Latino Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha confirmed on X that he was in the running. So far, the only woman to emerge as a possible candidate, as Politico reported, is Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow. She drew national acclaim on the left in 2022 after she delivered a speech in defiance of a Republican who cast her as a “groomer” in a fundraising appeal, which led to a speaking slot at this summer’s Democratic National Convention. \n\nStill looming out there: Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, who has developed a reputation as a prodigious fundraiser and field organizer. \n\n“Ben is seriously considering a run,” a person with knowledge of Wikler’s thinking told NBC News on Monday. \n\nThat’s on top of chatter around Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, former Chicago mayor and chief of staff to then-President Barack Obama. Emanuel has reached out to other DNC members to test the waters, according to two people close to him. \n\nThe DNC vice chair position is also drawing attention. Adam Parkhomenko, a Democratic operative who worked on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns, is considering a bid for the post, for which he unsuccessfully ran in 2017. \n\n“I am seriously considering stepping back into the race, and I promise to take the time to weigh this decision carefully, with the same dedication to our party and values that I’ve always carried,” Parkhomenko said in a message to supporters obtained by NBC News. \n\nAlso eyeing a run for the vice chair position is James Zogby, the founder of the Arab American Institute and longtime former DNC member who has criticized the party from the left. \n\nWhile it’s still too early to get a clear sense of the fault lines that will define the DNC leadership races, the 50-state strategy could be one. This is a vision — investing in red, blue and swing states alike — that Martin in particular has fully embraced. If Emanuel does get into the race, it’s a strategy he famously opposed, even getting into a public feud with Howard Dean over it, arguing the party should train its focus on battleground states. \n\nThe race could also expose divisions between an old era, one that embraced Obama — who had drastically diminished the role of the DNC and state parties by setting up a parallel entity in Organizing for America — and new faces who would bring fresh ideas to a party in search of a way forward. \n\nTrump is burning his political capital quickly \n\nBy Chuck Todd \n\nHere’s the political problem Donald Trump is creating for himself with his picks for the Cabinet and other positions: He’s taking full ownership of the entire bureaucracy now. There is no fantasy or mythical “deep state” to blame for not fulfilling his promises. He’s appointing folks he says share his vision — so no excuses of being jammed by the ol’ establishment wing of the GOP (like what happened in his first term). \n\nThis time, he has to deliver, and his ability to deliver depends on whether he can put together a stable set of political actors to not only do his bidding but also somehow deliver on his promises to a whole new group of voters who are “trying out” Trumpism for the very first time. \n\nIf the next six months at the Pentagon are more about which bathrooms folks can or can’t use and who can or can’t defend the country, Trump is going to find himself taking more of the heat for his controversial pick of defense chief than his actual pick for the post. \n\nThere are a lot of potential land mines that Trump and the newly empowered GOP need to avoid. One is misreading their mandate on the culture front. \n\nWhat many voters appeared to say with their votes, culturally, is that they don’t like to be told how they should behave. There’s a fierce libertarian streak in this country, and it can look “left” or “right” depending on which party is in power. If the Republicans go from preaching against “DEI” to essentially imposing their own culture, forcing Bible study in public schools (see Oklahoma) or using gender stereotypes rather than pure merit to decide whether someone belongs on the front lines of combat, then they will be committing the same sin they accused coastal elites of committing, of “imposing their own culture” on a public that doesn’t agree with their every belief. \n\nAnd this is the very risk Trump has already invited by deciding to pick the most controversial firebrand one could find in some of these key positions. If his picks cause instability, the public will reject this administration faster than he thinks. \n\nOne thing Trump and the GOP are already misreading about his so-called mandate is that he was elected despite his personal unpopularity. That is, he wasn’t elected proactively by the voters who took him over the edge; he was elected because of who he was not. \n\nThis wasn’t a decision voters made because they like Trump. To the contrary, they made this decision because they didn’t think the Biden-Harris administration understood how they live their lives. Does Trump understand it? Perhaps he doesn’t, but he certainly knew how to channel their frustrations into a vote-getting message, and he certainly exposed the Democrats as not having any clue about how the working class was faring in this economy. \n\nBut these moments of peak political capital are fleeting, and when they go, they go. Just ask Biden.',

        'California voters reject ballot measure to increase the state\'s minimum wage',
    body:
        'VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA have narrowly rejected a ballot measure that would have gradually increased the minimum wage in the state to \$18 per hour, NBC News projected Wednesday. \n\nIt’s the first time a ballot measure proposing to raise the statewide minimum wage has failed nationwide since 1996. \n\nThe California measure, listed as Proposition 32 on the ballot, proposed bumping the state\'s minimum wage to \$18 per hour by 2026, which would have made it the highest in the U.S. \n\nWith 92% of the vote counted, the “no” vote against the measure had the support of 50.8% of voters, while the “yes” vote had 49.2%. \n\nSupporters of the measure said it would have benefitted workers, while opponents argued that its passage would have increased costs for employers, which would have likely prompted them to fire employees. \n\nThe California Chamber of Commerce, which opposed the measure, lauded its defeat in a statement. \n\n“CalChamber opposed Prop. 32 because it would have resulted in higher costs for small business employers and consumers,” the group\'s CEO, Jennifer Barrera, said in a statement. “With the economy and costs top of mind for many voters this election, that message appears to have resonated.” \n\nCalifornia’s current state minimum wage for most workers is \$16 per hour, though under a law signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that went into effect in March, the minimum wage for many fast food workers is \$20 per hour. \n\nAnother law signed by Newsom increased the minimum wage in the state for many health care workers to \$25 per hour starting last month. \n\nCalifornia’s current \$16 minimum wage is already among the highest in the nation. Some cities within New York also implement a minimum wage of \$16 per hour, while Washington state’s minimum wage is \$16.26 per hour. Hawaii’s minimum wage is set to gradually increase to \$18 per hour in 2028 under a law passed in 2022. \n\nThe defeat is the first time in 28 years that a ballot measure to increase a state minimum wage was defeated. According to Ballotpedia, which tracks the outcomes of statewide ballot measures, voters had passed all 26 measures to increase state minimum wages that appeared on statewide ballots since 1996, when voters in Missouri and Montana rejected increases. \n\nMeanwhile, ballot measures in two other states to increase the minimum wage overwhelmingly passed this month. \n\nVoters in Alaska and Missouri approved measures to gradually raise their state minimum wages to \$15 per hour by 2026, according to NBC News projections, with increases after that year attached to economic data. Both measures won by 16-point margins.',

    title: 'Exxon Mobil signs non-binding lithium supply deal with LG Chem',
    body:
        'By Ernest Scheyder\n\nHOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said on Wednesday it has signed a non-binding lithium supply deal with battery parts maker LG Chem, the oil giant\'s second agreement to supply the electric vehicle battery metal from its proposed Arkansas project.\n\nExxon last year announced plans to extract lithium from the Smackover Formation, an underground deposit of salty water known as brine that stretches from Florida through Arkansas and into Texas, using at least one type of direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology.\n\nExxon and other oil companies such as Occidental Petroleum and Equinor are increasingly investing in lithium projects, partly due to their belief that extracting the metal from brine involves similar processes as petroleum extraction.\n\nThe LG Chem agreement, which would require Arkansas officials to set a state lithium royalty rate to be finalized, is for up to 100,000 metric tons of the ultralight metal over several years.\n\nThe move allows Exxon - which plans to self-fund its Arkansas project - to incorporate LG Chem\'s lithium quality specifications into its design plans. South Korea-based LG Chem plans to use the lithium at its Tennessee cathode facility, slated to open next year.\n\n"This is about building a relationship with a company that has the same ambitions as building out the North American (battery) supply chain as us," Patrick Howarth, head of Exxon\'s lithium business, told Reuters.\n\nExxon expects lithium demand to rise despite U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\'s campaign vow to end the "EV mandate," Howarth said.\n\n"We know that the world\'s going to need a lot more lithium than it\'s producing today," he said.\n\nFinancial terms of the deal - including the price per metric ton of lithium that LG Chem would pay Exxon - would be negotiated as part of any final contract. SK On, a unit of SK Innovation, signed a non-binding lithium supply deal with Exxon in June.\n\nDespite recent lithium market turbulence, Howarth said Exxon has "seen really strong support from our potential customer base."\n\nROYALTY\n\nArkansas officials earlier this month rejected a proposed lithium royalty rate of 1.82% from Exxon and others.\n\nOfficials have been debating a lithium royalty since at least 2018, with tension centering on how the metal should be valued given the cost for equipment to filter it from brine, which unlike oil typically has no intrinsic market value.\n\nLandowners want a higher rate, noting that most U.S. oil royalties pay between 8% and 12%.\n\n"It\'s one of the key regulatory issues that we need to resolve to bring these projects to market," Howarth said, adding that Exxon could leave Arkansas - where it has invested more than 100 million - if the rate was too high.\n\nOfficials hinted a 2.5% rate could be acceptable, which Howarth said would be "in the range that we would be able to move forward." Exxon would need to formally propose a new rate, which is likely in the near future, he added.\n\nExxon declined to say how much lithium it expects to produce annually in Arkansas, although the amount would depend on which DLE technology it chooses.\n\n"We\'re definitely narrowing down the selection," Howarth said. "But we\'re still keeping multiple providers in play."',

Advocates of its claimed role as a modern-day store of value cherish the six-figure level as a rebuttal of skeptics who see little utility in crypto and decry its links to money laundering and criminal activity.\n\n“Buyers are strangling the sellers,” said IG Australia Pty Market Analyst Tony Sycamore. “While I’m not sure it’s all going to be smooth sailing as it edges closer to the 100,000 mark, the demand appears to be insatiable.”\n\nMicroStrategy, the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin, on Wednesday announced an almost 50% increase in planned sales of convertible senior notes, to 2.6 billion, to fund purchases of the token.\n\nThe once obscure software maker now bills itself as a Bitcoin treasury company and has a roughly 31 billion stockpile of the digital asset.\n\nTrump has vowed to create a supportive US regulatory framework for digital assets and set up a strategic Bitcoin stockpile. The timeline for implementation of his promises and the feasibility of the Bitcoin reserve remain uncertain. The president-elect used to be a crypto skeptic but changed tack after digital-asset firms spent heavily during election campaigning to promote their interests.',

    title: 'Applying AI and Analytics to Emissions Data',
    body:
        'There\'s little doubt about the impact of AI on businesses. When it comes to an organization\'s emissions data, it is generally understood that applying AI should bring useful insights from this critical data.\n\nIn terms of emissions data, companies are challenged in two areas. The first is driven by regulations requiring emissions reporting and ultimately emissions reduction over time. The second area relates to spotting business opportunities related to emissions such as investment credits available from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act for carbon sequestration and storage.\n\nUsing AI against large emissions datasets can highlight opportunities for emissions reduction relating to specific parts of a business or supply chain or opportunities for investment related to emissions.\n\nA prerequisite is that the data must be well organized and consistent. Consistency includes data and metadata for emissions activity, units of measure, the emissions calculation formula used and the emissions component category. The data consistency issue extends to organizational attributes describing the structure of the company\'s organizational boundaries, location, facility and equipment. It also extends to descriptions of product life cycles and the reporting domain.',

    body:
        'AI is everywhere these days and with good reason, as the ability of large language models (LLMs) to augment and speed up business processes is transforming how companies operate. Many of the scenarios discussed are what I\'d call "application" use cases. These are things like using ChatGPT to write marketing content, summarize a call center recording or even provide code for a bubble sort algorithm in Python. These are impressive capabilities but if you look at each example you\'ll notice they are specific generative asks. We use the LLM to provide a specific and relatively narrow business function. As AI improves, we\'ll start seeing complex business processes leveraging AI, which will have a tsunami effect on business. \n\nOne example of going beyond these generative application use cases is using AI to connect all the content sources that run our businesses. AI runs on data, as do all the companies I\'ve ever worked for. We collect and generate data via emails, slack threads, Zoom calls, finance reports and myriad other business applications. This data is a treasure trove of information on how to operate and optimize a business, and there are analytics applications that excel at digesting and analyzing this data. \n\nAt InMoment, we work on such applications and I can say with certainty that the most challenging part of our job is gaining access to all of these silos of information and figuring out how to normalize these disparate sources so we can look across the breadth of our customers\' data. There is an unspoken understanding in the industry that the hardest part of B2B software work is the data integration between systems. In this field, resolving data connectivity issues often paves the way for project success.',

    title: 'What your heart rate says about your fitness level',
    body:
        'A person\'s heart rate can say a lot about their fitness levels.\n\nWith the average smartwatch or fitness tracker, people have a wealth of information about their health and fitness, including their heart rate. From heart rate zones to variability, there\'s a lot of information at our disposal, but sometimes the meaning of all these statistics can get lost on those unfamiliar with them.\n\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Kathryn Larson recommends that patients determine their health and fitness goals first to identify what they plan to do with the information. She told The New York Times, "The discussion changes a lot based on what that patient or athlete wants to do with that data."\n\nExperts suggest measuring your heart rate - the number of heartbeats in a minute when you are not exerting yourself - without a device by finding your pulse in your neck or wrist to get the ball rolling. When you place your fingers by either, count the beats you can detect within 15 seconds, and multiply that number by four - that\'s how you\'ll find your heart rate.\n\nMeanwhile, your maximum heart rate can be determined by measuring how fast your heart beats during intense exercise, which is when fitness trackers like the Apple Watch come in handy. Throughout the day, devices like these can measure your heart rate through a tiny light that measures changes in the blood flowing through the vessels in your wrist. A healthy resting rate lies between 60 and 100 beats per minute, however, people with higher fitness levels like athletes will often have lower resting heart rates than less active people.\n\nWith this information, you can determine how you want to approach different zones of your heart rate and find out what you need to do to train them. Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Dr Tamanna Singh explained to the outlet, "The best way to really understand zones is by understanding the effort, and the purpose."\n\nFitness trackers can estimate your heart rate zones and inform you how to reach them in your workout. They can also help you design workouts that specifically target goals including building endurance and stamina.\n\nExperts recommend different exercises for each zone: zone one can be either a warm-up or a cool-down, zone two should be slightly more challenging but manageable for long stretches, zone three should be higher intensity and less sustainable, and zone four should be what you consider your threshold workout in which you max out.\n\nDevices can also calculate heart rate variability, which monitors how recovered or tired you are between workouts by tracking how your heart rate naturally fluctuates between beats. Lower numbers after a hard workout indicate that the person needs a longer recovery time while higher numbers show that the person can bounce back much quicker.\n\nHowever, experts note that fitness trackers aren\'t always reliable and can make mistakes, adding that prospective users shouldn\'t rely too much on the data. Dr Larson told the Times, "Any device is going to be detecting things accurately at times and also can be sometimes unreliable."\n\nShe recommends trying to talk while exercising to gauge your heart health, paying attention to this can be an easy way to monitor how you\'re doing without any fancy devices.',

    title: 'Small firms see wage bills jump 14% – report',
    body:
        'Small businesses saw their wage bills surge by 14% at the end of last year in a sign of ongoing cost pressures across the sector, a report has shown.\n\nThe latest Sage small business tracker, compiled with the Centre for Economics and Business Research, found that while earnings growth is easing back more widely across the UK, total wage bills are continuing to rise for small firms at a rapid pace.\n\nIt showed that SMEs saw nominal wages increase by 13.8% in the final three months of 2023, up from growth 11.1% in the previous quarter.\n\nThis comes despite an easing in wage growth seen nationwide, with official figures on Tuesday revealing that regular pay, excluding bonuses, fell back to 6.1% in the three months to January – the slowest growth for more than a year.\n\nIt signals the ongoing wage cost pressures faced by small firms as they battle to attract and retain workers, even though other overheads are reducing, according to the report.\n\nThe report said: "Following the pandemic, wage growth within small businesses – as all businesses – has picked up markedly.\n\n"This reflects the ongoing tightness of the UK labour market, where workers have gained increased bargaining power, as well as the increased cost of living."\n\nSage said its data is "proving more volatile compared to the Office for National Statistics data, indicating small businesses experience more wage growth variability than the wider UK economy".\n\nThe figures from the report, which analyses anonymised Sage Accounting and Payroll data of more than 136,000 UK businesses, highlights that there are still underlying inflation pressures in the economy, which may hamper the Bank of England\'s battle to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.\n\nThe Bank has been keeping a close eye on wage data in particular in its bid to rein in inflation.\n\nBut with small firms still seeing their wage bills rocket higher and with the national living wage set to rise from £10.42 an hour to £11.44 from April for nearly three million people, there are fears that it may hamper the Bank\'s efforts on inflation.\n\nHowever, the report also flagged the resilience of the small business sector despite the woes in the economy.\n\nIt revealed small business revenues rose 0.9% on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, while average real underlying earnings surged 23.2% in the year to the fourth quarter, up from growth of 10.5% in the previous three months.\n\nThis comes despite the UK slipping into a technical recession in the final six months of 2023.\n\nThe report also found that, in spite of the steep increases in wage bills, overall cost pressures have started to abate, with real overheads falling by 1.8% in the year to the fourth quarter, which is the largest annual decline seen over 2023.\n\nDerk Bleeker, chief commercial officer at Sage, said: "Small businesses are continuing to show signs of weathering tough economic conditions."',
